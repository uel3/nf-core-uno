## Introduction

**nf-core/uno** is a bioinformatics pipeline for the co-assembly, binning, and read mapping of mNGS outbreak samples from the **The UnO project** 

<!-- TODO nf-core:
   Complete this sentence with a 2-3 sentence summary of what types of data the pipeline ingests, a brief overview of the
   major pipeline sections and the types of output it produces. You're giving an overview to someone new
   to nf-core here, in 15-20 seconds. For an example, see https://github.com/nf-core/rnaseq/blob/master/README.md#introduction

## Pipeline summary
UnO is an mNGS bioinformatics pipeline that supports **The UnO Project**. nf-core UnO is the second tier The UnO project which analyzes set of mNGS reads from a well-characterized outbreak. The draft UnO pipeline takes as input outbreak sets of mNGS reads. Reads are co-assembled into a single outbreak assembly and then binned into Metagenomic Assembled Genomes (MAGs). Individual mNGS reads are mapped back to MAGs to identify individual sample contributions. MAGs in common across individual mNGS reads are chosen for further analysis and characterization.   
<!-- TODO nf-core: Include a figure that guides the user through the major workflow steps. Many nf-core
     workflows use the "tube map" design for that. See https://nf-co.re/docs/contributing/design_guidelines#examples for examples.   -->
<!-- TODO nf-core: Fill in short bullet-pointed list of the default steps in the pipeline -->

1. Inital reference-based taxonomic classfication of reads is performed using ([`MIDAS2`](https://github.com/czbiohub-sf/MIDAS2))
2. Read QC ([`FastQC`](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/))
3. Perform quality and adapter trimming on raw reads ([`Trimmomatic`](http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic))
4. Read QC on trimmed reads
5. Co-assemble mNGS reads from outbreak dataset into single outbreak assembly ([`Megahit`](https://github.com/voutcn/megahit))
6. Preparation for binning of metagenomic co-assembly with ([`Bowtie2`](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)). Outbreak co-assembly is used to create an index which individual reads are mapped to determine depth information for downstream binning tools. 
7. ([`MetaBat2`](https://bitbucket.org/berkeleylab/metabat/src/master/)) and ([`MaxBin2`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/maxbin2/)) are used to bin MAGs.
8. ([`DAStool`](https://github.com/cmks/DAS_Tool)) is used to refine bins.
9. ([`Bowtie2`](http://bowtie-bio.sourceforge.net/bowtie2/index.shtml)) is used to map individual reads back to refined bins to identify MAGs in common across outbreak samples.
10. ([`CheckM`](https://ecogenomics.github.io/CheckM/)) is used to asses quality of refined bins. 
11. ([`MultiQC`](http://multiqc.info/)) is used to summarize some of the findings and software versions.

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> If you are new to Nextflow and nf-core, please refer to [this page](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/installation) on how to set-up Nextflow. Make sure to [test your setup](https://nf-co.re/docs/usage/introduction#how-to-run-a-pipeline) with `-profile test` before running the workflow on actual data.
```console
nextflow run nf-core/uno --input /path/to/UnOsamplesheet.csv -profile <conda> -c <CONFIG> --outdir <OUTDIR>
```
<!-- TODO nf-core: Describe the minimum required steps to execute the pipeline, e.g. how to prepare samplesheets.
     Explain what rows and columns represent. For instance (please edit as appropriate):

First, prepare a samplesheet with your input data that looks as follows:

`samplesheet.csv`:

```csv
sample,group,short_reads_1,short_reads_2,
SAMPLE1,UnO,/path/to/reads/SAMPLE1_1.fastq.gz,/path/to/reads/SAMPLE1_2.fastq.gz,
SAMPLE2,UnO,/path/to/reads/SAMPLE2_1.fastq.gz,/path/to/reads/SAMPLE2_2.fastq.gz,
SAMPLE3,UnO,/path/to/reads/SAMPLE3_1.fastq.gz,/path/to/reads/SAMPLE3_2.fastq.gz,
```

Each row represents a pair of fastq files (paired end).

-->

Now, you can run the pipeline using:

<!-- TODO nf-core: update the following command to include all required parameters for a minimal example -->

```bash
nextflow run nf-core/uno \
   -profile <docker/singularity/conda/institute> \
   -genome GRCh38
   --input samplesheet.csv \
   --outdir <OUTDIR>
```

> [!WARNING]
> Please provide pipeline parameters via the CLI or Nextflow `-params-file` option. Custom config files including those provided by the `-c` Nextflow option can be used to provide any configuration _**except for parameters**_;
> see [docs](https://nf-co.re/usage/configuration#custom-configuration-files).

For more details and further functionality, please refer to the [usage documentation](https://github.com/uel3/nf-core-uno/blob/master/docs/usage.md) and the [parameter documentation](https://github.com/uel3/nf-core-uno/blob/master/docs/parameters.md).

## Pipeline output

Current output of the draft UnO output consists of the user specified <OUTDIR> with following directories: Assembly, FastQC, GenomeBinning, multiqc, pipeline_info, QC_shortreads, and Trimmomatic. 
For more details about the output files and reports, please refer to the
[output documentation](https://github.com/uel3/nf-core-uno/wiki/Output).
